0.6.1
NOTE: Please delete/replace your mana batteries, crafting plates, halos and mana orbs to adjust to the new mana numbers.
Redo crafting plate code. It no longer re-renders the whole chunk every single tick. Using liblib animation system now.
Changed structure rendering to be easier to follow + added structure error highlighting.
mana storage changed. It's now in the player rather than the halos. Halos are now "antennae" of mana. Use mana syringes to fuel yourself up while a cheap haloInv is equipped. Mana orbs no longer right-clickable.
Completely rebalance mana numbers. (Please replace all your current items and blocks to adjust to the new system)
Fixed underworld teleportation. No longer kills you.
Removed wisdom wood planks from oredict to support our wisdom sticks recipe.
Improved pearl /give command. Added names for a pearl's quality. (ex: apex pearl = best quality)
Added duration to zone's applicable modifier list
Make devil dust crafting not destroy server performance + fixed particle syncing.
Cape textures are now varied. Special players get their own capes.
Fixed version checker disabling in the config not working.
Update book jsons to preview text properly.
